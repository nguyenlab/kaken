  <li>Leaving comments on web documents (or other web objects) have become an important feature for many web sites, 
   especially the social websites (Yahoo! News, CNNnews, Japan today allows users to comment on its news articles). 
   In addition, with the growing of social media (Facebook, Twitter), many web documents allow social users give comments. 
   Those social media comments contributed by readers provide valuable information to better understand the documents. 
   It also brings more useful topics for other readers and social users when reading the news, especially about the political opinions, new products, and discussion about laws as well as policy of governments. 
   Thus, understanding both the comments and the content of the documents would be very useful for readers. </li>
